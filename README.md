Task: 4 Library Management System

Project Overview  
The project involves developing a **Python program to manage library resources** such as books, magazines, and DVDs. The system is designed to streamline library operations, offering functionalities for adding new items, managing checkouts and returns, handling overdue fines, and searching for items based on specific criteria.

Key Activities  

1. Resource Management:  
   - Allows users to add new library items (e.g., books, magazines, DVDs) with details such as title, author, category, and availability status.

2. Checkout and Return:  
   - Enables users to check out items, update availability status, and record due dates.  
   - Supports item return functionality, updating records accordingly.

3. Overdue Fine Management:  
   - Calculates overdue fines based on the number of days past the due date.  
   - Provides a summary of fines owed by each user.  

4. Search Functionality:  
   - Allows users to search for items by title, author, or category.  
   - Displays search results with relevant details (e.g., availability status, location).  

Technology Used  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Data Handling: Uses Python dictionaries and lists to manage library resources and user records.  
- Date and Time Management: Leverages Python's `datetime` module to track due dates and calculate overdue fines.  
- Search Functionality: Implements search logic using string matching techniques for efficient querying.  
- User Interaction: Simple text-based interface using `input()` for user input and output.  

Key Insights  
- The program provides a user-friendly solution for library management with core functionalities that ensure efficient operations.  
- The implementation highlights modularity and scalability, making it easier to add new resource types or features in the future.  
- Future enhancements could include:  
  - A GUI-based interface for better user interaction.  
  - Integration with a database for persistent storage and multi-user access.  
  - Features like user authentication, notifications for overdue items, and detailed usage reports.  

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, including data management, user interaction, and real-world application development. It serves as a robust starting point for building advanced library management systems.
