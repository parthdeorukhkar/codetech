Project Overview    
The project involves developing a **Python program to track and manage student grades**. The application is designed to enable users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and provide additional insights such as the overall letter grade or GPA.

Key Activities  

1. Grade Input:  
   - Allows users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.  

2. Average Calculation:  
   - Computes the average grade across all entered subjects or assignments.  

3. Overall Grade Display:  
   - Outputs the average grade alongside the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) or GPA.  

4. Additional Features:  
   - Includes functionality to display a summary of grades for each subject or assignment.  
   - Provides grade distribution analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses.  

Technology Used  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Data Handling: Uses Python dictionaries and lists to store and process grades for each subject or assignment.  
- Calculations: Implements mathematical operations to compute averages and determine letter grades or GPA.  
- User Interaction: Simple text-based input and output using `input()` for interaction.  

Key Insights  
- The program currently handles numerical grades and converts them into letter grades or GPA based on predefined scales.  
- The modular approach to grade input, calculation, and display ensures maintainability and scalability.  
- The project demonstrates a solid understanding of data structures, user interaction, and arithmetic operations in Python.  
- Future enhancements could include:
  - Graphical representation of grade distribution (e.g., bar charts or pie charts).  
  - A GUI interface for better usability.  
  - Integration with external systems for grade import/export.


This program serves as an excellent exercise in **Python programming** and demonstrates practical applications of programming in education management.
